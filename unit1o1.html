    <h2 id=outcome1_question_one>1.1  Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>In the world we live in today IT plays a vital role for almost any business imaginable. Retail, in particular, relies on it tremendously. For instance, operations can be honed with regard to stock - through tracking what sells and feeding back point-of-sales data into IT systems, so that product flow can be increased in some areas and wastage reduced elsewhere.</p>
    <p>However, it is the revolution in online sales is the most pronounced way that IT has transformed our habits with regard to retail. Online purchasing is good for commerce as businesses can track customer behaviour whilst driving down the cost how products are made available.</p>
    <p>Expensive premises in the high street, formerly required to display wares can be tapered back or – say, in the case of Amazon, jettisoned entirely in favour of warehouse hubs that serve a wider client base, who can view the goods from the comfort of their own homes or even if they are on the move and have smart phone of tablet with them.</p>
    <p>The added value of the economy of convenience has also proven to be a godsend to people with disabilities for instance agoraphobics and people who suffer from panic attacks in crowded shopping centres, or the elderly and infirm for whom simple shopping trip could prove exhausting.</p>
    <p>Technology has also proven itself saviour for both consumers and business during The Covid 19 crisis which we were in the midst of at the time of writing. It has probably helped hinder what might have been a more rampant spread of the virus as quarantine measures were a lot easier to comply with, through switching to online purchasing habits.</p>
    <p>It is not only retail that has benefited from IT though, every business found they had a lifeline to continue operating. Staff in many sectors found they could work from home and other businesses, like Code Nation itself were able to continue operating and teaching through the use of Zoom forums and distance learning whilst physical classes were prohibited.</p>
    <p>IT drives down costs and allows business to be far nimbler in turnaround of projects and transactions</p>

    <h2 id=outcome1_question_two>1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – <i>what do you need to make projects successful?
    What tools? What skills?</i></h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Successful IT projects need time to plan and research. There are tools online that come to a programmer’s aid if studied for instance <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">W3Scools.com</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[III]</a> and <a href="https://www.quackit.com/html/tags/html_a_tag.cfm" target="_blank">Quackit.com</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[IV]</a>.</p>
    <p>These are websites with excellent indexes that can be consulted to find the correct types of code required to perform a desired feature in my website project.</p>
    <p>The actual tools that I used for this project are Visual Studio Code which is described as a “source-code editor” that can be used in a variety of programming Languages, including Java, Java Script, CSS and HTML.
        We used the HTML language for the raw skeleton of our webpage and then CSS was employed to design the appearance of the content laid out in HTML.</p>
        <p>Practical assistance was made available to us in the form of the software packages known as
            <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/about"target="_blank"> Slack</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[V]</a>.</p>
            <p>Which is a forum for communicating with other class members, meaning the availability of mutual support could be accessed by conferring with like-minded people in our Code Nation slack community.</p>
            <p>And, also<a href="https://trello.com/"target="_blank"> Trello</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html"> [VI]</a> - a virtual pin-board for keeping track of progress.</p>

    <h2 id=outcome1_question_three>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – <i>e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</i> </h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>IT has come up with numerous applications that have been tailored to users to help them plan their workload. On this Code Nation course I was introduced to Trello which is a virtual notice board where tasks can be noted as and when inspiration hits, merely by logging in on a smart phone. From there ideas can be honed in to tasks and their changing status recorded for anyone with access to the Trello link. </p>
    <p>If the work being recorded in Trello is available to a team, each member can refer to it and see where things are at, it’s a very useful aide-memoire for all involved in the work in question and if carefully managed by someone assigned as administrator, then their overview of progress can be communicated across the team to ensure that repetition if avoided, or when developments trigger the commencement of further tasks in the planned work.</p>

    <h2 id=outcome1_question_four>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – <i>what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</i></h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Projects in IT are just as prone to failure as any other enterprise. One of the most notable failures was the digitisation of NHS’s operations. This project was initiated in 2002 but went over time and budget that it was finally pulled from any further development in 2011 after being plagued for almost a decade by mounting set-backs, described in a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24130684"target="_blank"> BBC report</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[VIII]</a>: as <i>' technical problems and contractual wrangling'</i>. The project wasted<a href="Images/nhsdisater.jpg"> £9.8bn</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[IX]</a> in tax payers’ money.</p>
    <p>So disagreement over payments to developers and the inadequacy coding languages selected for a job can impact disastrously if not fit purpose. </p>
    <p>In terms of smaller home-spun projects failure or setbacks can be also be attributed to choosing the wrong coding language for the task. Other threats include a poor internet connection, cyber-attacks or even unfortunate happenstance that the coder was not prepared for. For instance, they could spill a hot drink over their keyboard or household pet might become jealous of ‘that thing’ that seems to be distracting their master’s attention and may leap onto the keys and delete everything. So, in regard to those to farcical threats it would be wise to keep liquids on the floor and away from your device – and to make sure the dog or cat are well fed or restricted from  the workspace.</p>       
    <p>Cyber-attacks are also a nuisance so it is wise to careful what you click on when researching and be especially mindful of unsolicited emails</p>
    <p>A lot can be mitigated by reflecting on this, have you really chosen the coding language for the job? Perhaps you should research which are the strongest candidates for, say running statistical data in the client’s desired project or using software that provides the tools to nail down the client’s desired need for a sales platform that grabs attention. </p>
    <p>In terms of the applications that can aid and abet us it is also advisable to always remember the human element. For instance, Trello, as mentioned is a very useful tool but it may hinder things if everyone involved is not consulting it regularly or if there is no gatekeeper- a kind of <a href="Images/centraloversight.jpg">mission controller</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[X]</a> who prompts the rest of the team about the status of things and makes sure that everyone is on the same page so that tasks and coding fall into <a href="images/everyoneinsynch.jpg">cadence</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XI]</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="https://zoom.us/"target="_blank">Zoom</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XII]</a> can be useful in this respect because no matter how effective written communication may be in Trello or Slack it could still be misconstrued. Anyone who has ever had an email misunderstood or, worse, cause offence unintentionally through poor choice of phrasing or unfortunate emphasis would likely concede that catch ups in person are important from time to time.</p>
    <p>However amazing the technological opportunities out there are, it’s worth remembering that the most advanced computer is still in our own heads and that the outputs we can convey to others with the aid of Gesture, expression, posture and paralinguistics are innately understood far more effectively than language alone, when stripped of the human element. The well-known adage that language only makes up a surprisingly low percentage of overall meaning conveyed should not be forgotten and its not a good idea to favour of tech tools over regualar stand-up meetings though zoom, or face-to-face in person.

    <h2 id=outcome1_question_five>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – 
    <i>how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</i></h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>What you choose to use for a coding project depends very much on the nature of the technological. As mentioned in section 1.4 you should establish from the outset which devices (hardware) and programming tools (software) are most fit for purpose. For instance, I have always used a PC but, as I understand it, people I have met who deal predominately with IT projects that have a creative bent swear by Apple Macs. What I also have discovered through talking to PC fans is that Apple Mac fans have to shell out a lot of money for software that is bespoke whereas PC users have a lot more flexibility when it comes to adopting software usable on their devices. That is hearsay, but I’ve heard enough Techy friends argue the point that there must be an element of truth on both sides.</p>
    <p>It may be worthwhile setting up devices that have a high mobility factor germane to them so that you can access your project on the move, especially if the project is has a creative or artistic aspect to it. This is because you never know when inspiration my take hold so, for instance, having your mobile handy when on a night out could be useful if something suddenly inspires you if you have downloaded the Trello application, since then you can make a quick memo to yourself about the idea whilst out and about.</p>
    <p>However, trying to develop a programme on a phone in its entirety is inadvisable. Software like<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"target="_blank"> Visual Studio Code</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XIII]</a> (VS code), where our HTML, Python and CCS code is laid out is best tinkered with on a decent laptop or desktop device, where you can type a lot more comfortably and adjust the size of aspects of your work so that you are not straining.</p> 
    <p>Also it is worth bearing in mind that is not cost-effective to reinvent the wheel from scratch. If you find a library of resources out there in the technological ether that can be adapted to your needs, then it may be savvy to see how others have achieved similar outcomes to those that you desire yourself.</p>

</div>
<div>
    <p>Visual Studio code was the most profound revelation to me. I had often pondered, without ever researching things before Code Nation, what all the mind-bending stuff was behind a webpage after clicking on developer tools on a website. It really baffled me, and put me off ever attempting it for myself. So VS code really surprised me as I thought ah! this is where things are done – not by cutting and pasting it into Word, as I had tried in my ignorance where, of course nothing happened.</p>
    <p>It really did reveal to me what I formerly considered to be some kind of closely guarded magic circle. I really liked the way that, in Python the terminal could be activated to display the outcome of each piece of code and, in HTML how you can switch back and forth to your website to get a glimpse of how things are playing out. The auto-correct dropdown was informative, though sometime distracting but needs to be heeded I think in early days. I would not switch if off unless I was comfortable with skills I had acquired in terms of writing script until the script I was employing had been mastered. I also like the way one can comment out lines of code to focus on a specific piece, that is an excellent feature.</p>
    <p>Trello as already mentioned is a cool bit of software for navigating through steps in a project and <a href="https://github.com/Github"target="_blank">GitHub</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XIV]</a>  is also a useful platform where we can develop a portfolio and plan something on it.</p>

<div>
    <h2 id=outcome1_question_seven>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that
        impact digital projects – <i>How does GDPR impact digital projects? </i></h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>The most prominent piece of legislation that has impacted on digital projects in recent times are the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) which was introduced across Europe on 25th May 2018. GDPR aims to tackle the complexities of information collection and information sharing bought about by advancing technology, and bolsters the pre-existing Data Protection Act (1998) which was struggling to cope with the vast amounts of personal information collected and the global nature of its distribution. Both these acts complement each other.</p>
    <p>Data controllers must do a lot of due diligence to ensure that data processors who they are sharing the data with also meet the regulations, and to keep evidence of all due diligence, so that if matters come into question they can show that they endeavoured to keep their side of the street clean. The consequences for a data breach are phenomenal – the ceiling fine for major <a href="Images/thelaw.jpg">transgressions</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XV]</a> can amount to £18 million, or else 4% of annual turnover.</p>
    <p>The principles of GDPR are: lawfulness, fairness and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimisation; accuracy; storage limitation; security; and accountability. Which basically boils down to: personal data must be accurate and up to date. </p>
    <p>IT data on individuals must be kept <a href="Images/gdprrestricctions.jpg">securely</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XVI]</a> and ONLY for as <a href="Images/gdprprivacy.jpg">long as needed</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XVII]</a> - for the purpose for which it was collected. Organisations must be transparent about their compliance and must have a clear legal basis for every use of data. If the legal basis is consent, the consent must be for a specific use of the data and this use can’t be changed without renewing consent.</p>
    <p>Remember that consent is only one of several legal bases for processing personal data, i.e. consent isn’t always needed, although transparency via a privacy notice is always needed).  Here is an example of a <a href="https://bbcdevwebfiles.blob.core.windows.net/webfiles/Your%20Council/GDPR/Civil%20Registration.pdf" target="_blank">privacy notice</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XVIII]</a>.</p>
    <p>We probably concede that data kept and explained about in the above link makes perfect sense because of its sensitivity and that operation as important as a local council will naturally hold person data. This is a good example because they detail the relevant laws and the basis for processing. They also show that the job involves sharing data with lots of other bodies for various reasons (i.e. national statistics). It seems like, for births marriages and deaths, legal obligation will be the main basis for processing. They will be handling a lot of ‘special category data’ (i.e. sensitive data such as race, religion, health, genetic data) – and for that they seem to have done extra due diligence by way of a data protection impact assessments That is one of the reason why census returns are locked from the public for 100 years, to ensure people’s privacy is protected. However, it’s worth remembering that GDPR doesn’t apply to dead people (although I don’t suppose that has much effect on the work a local council with regard to Births marriages and deaths because of the closed period’s extent.</p>
    <p>So we’d probably agree that, of course, such a behemoth or an enterprise should rightly be storing information in a responsible manner, as would a bank or any other powerful organisations. But GDPR applies equally to all types of business. For example, see the link below, this is the privacy statement on my cousin Lisa’s website. She is an artist and established <a href="https://www.ellulceramics.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">ceramicist</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XIX]</a>. However, even such outwardly harmless digital marketing platforms must also adhere to GDPR. I think Lisa has explained things rather well (and yes this a plug!)</p>
    <p>Websites also need to establish themselves in such a way that information requests from their clientele or membership subscribers, for data that they suspect you hold, can be made available promptly. This is where the <a href="images/freedomofinformation.jpg">Freedom of Information Act</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XX]</a> (FOI), which came into force in January 2005, comes into play. FOI is legislation that enables citizens to access your data in the capacity that it affects them. All digital platforms that have been provided with such information must have measures in place to respond candidly to such enquires. It cannot be ignored just because the information requested might be uncomfortable to reveal. If you try to brush such requests under the carpet, then you will find yourself open to litigation. </p>
    <p>If you are operating above board then you should have no worries about disclosing what you have upon request. One of the peculiarities of FOI is that even if you have kept records that you should have destroyed within the prescribed time limits, or not rightfully have stored at all then you will still have to make this data available. This is important for public bodies especially, because if you keep records that you could have legally destroyed and are then requested to reveal them through an FOI enquiry you will still have to do so even if that may cause concern.</p>
    <p>If you withhold data of public concern your operation could wind up in a lot of trouble with the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Information Commissioner’s Office</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXI]</a>.</p>
    <p>This is why it is important for front end developers working on websites' usability and who design prompts within the site that request personal information input should be in close contact with back end coders, and both should be overseen by their company’s information compliance officer/data controller. The data controller should research and  set out retention schedules (<a href="images/retentionsceduleexample.jpg">here is an example</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXII]</a>) and work with both teams of coders to ensure the all all content likely to be garnered online is linked to  back-end coding which embed flags, set to trigger at timely interludes, so that housekeeping and data hygene can be maintained in an orderly fashion, <i>automatically</i> and as a matter of course - to ensure the necessary culling of personal data at the <a href="images/frontendbackenddatahandling.jpg">right point</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXIII]</a> in the future</p>
