<h1>
    Hello! 
    <br>My Name is Jame.
    <br>Welcome to my first 
    <br>go at html and CSS.
</h1>
</div>
<h2>
    <br><em>I'm a qualified <a href="Images/archive.jpg" target="_blank">archivist</a></em>
    <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html" target="_blank">[I]</a>. 
</h2>

<h2>Getting around</h2>

<h3>The main content of this web-site consists of 20
    <br>questions concerning what we have been taught at
    <br><a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation</a>
    <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html" target="_blank">[II]</a> about IT and coding; prompting 
    <br>us to reflect on how we built our site - as we 
    <br>went. Answers and thoughts are grouped in 4 
    <br>sections called '<em>Outcomes</em>'.
</h3>

<h3>Links to other Units and Outcomes, 
    <br> Acknowledgments & References 
    <br>and about me are at the
    <br>top of this page.
    </h3>
    
<h3>On each unit's outcome page, you can click on the answer
    <br>you wish to read at the beginning. Or else you can 
    <br>scroll downthrough them. There are options to click
    <br>and return tthe top of the page after every answer.  
</h3>

<h3>I have used a command called ‘target_blank’ on all links to 
    <br>other websites, so that they open in a new tab at the top of 
    <br>the screen. This is so you can leave them open to read fully
    <br>later and click back on my page tab to resume.
</h3>

<h3>Other links to personal photos and images- I’ve named
   <br>‘blip-memes,’ are not coded to open in a new tab. They
   <br>were intended to momentarily accentuate a point under 
   <br>discussion, visually, for a second or so, but I had 
   <br>trouble solving that (discussed in answer 1.2.4).
    </h3>

<h3>The exception is my ‘archivist’ photo above, which <i>does</i> open in a
    <br>new tab - for accessibility reasons. Because I’m hoping, if you are
    <br>not internet experienced, that you’ve seen the visible tab options
    <br>up top and, so, been able to switch back. In future, click on the
    <br>browser back button (an arrow <i>pointing</i> left that’s at top left of
    <br>your screen) to return from my ‘blip-memes’ to my pages.
    </h3>

<h3></h3>


    <h3>I hope you make it to the end without keeling over...</h3>
