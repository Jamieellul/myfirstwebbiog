    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Thanks to <i>all</i> the virtual classmates on The Develop Coding course, for sharing ideas, encouraging each other and their humorous conversations and posts. Particularly my break-away Python-text-based-adventure-game project cohorts Aimee and Gloria for their in-depth notions on post-apocalyptic Zombies and the chance for romance there-in – I was touched. 
    Thanks to <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/about/people/" target="_blank">Code Nation staff</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXXVII]</a> in general for promoting their course, via the DWP, to people at a low ebb during lockdown and uncertain times; it was a great confidence booster! 
    To admissions advisor Ezra Christensen for letting me know that coding is useful, viable and a possible skill to engage in for all walks of life. 
    To the teaching staff we had sessions with: Leona So, Alex Coop, Jacob Reilly-Cooper (Mum-On-Facebook syntax had me going for over an hour), Dan Krishnan and Pedro Silva. 
    Also Dan Russell for letting us know that Code Nation are not just a flash-in-the-pan conveyer belt but a sustainable way into learning and selling yourself on line. Joined up thinking is always cool.
    Not forgetting the Python extraordinaire tutor Mike Clare who made himself available for help and advice well beyond his remit and…totally...our principal tutor and guide; some fella apparently called Jordan Fannon, but who we all knew as the self-effacing, patient and dry witted JAY!!!! Thanks.</p>

    <p>And, finally, thanks for the cats.</p> 
    <p>Cats on websites,</p> 
    <p>cats on Zoom,</p>
    <p>cats everywhere… </p>
    <p>throughout the course - trying to shut down student’s computers and generally getting in the way of their owners – very amusing.</p>
    <p>As they have been constant, and as I was Lacking in any cat stuff during the course I want to make my last contribution one about cats with the following statement:</p> 
    <p id="cattheory"><i>“Wouldn’t it be great if we were all cats? Life would be a breeze. For a start - you’d do what you want - when you want, beholden to no one. And, financially, things would be so much easier. Us humans must spend at least fiver on food a day; as cats, a 98p can of Wiskas spread across two days would prove ample.”</i><a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXXVIII]</a></p>
    <p>(If you reckon that dittie could get published on Viz's Top-Tips page drop me a line; and I'll submit.)</p>
