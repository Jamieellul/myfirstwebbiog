    <p> I was happy with the tools that I had been made aware of in this course particularly VS studio, as I found it a revelation that allowed me to see how code was connected to the presentation of content. However, I have not had time to look into what I expect is wealth of other tools, including script editor alternatives to VS studio that may be out there. On the whole though, I liked VS studio code and what few aspects of it that I did find tiresome sometimes would more than likely be adjustable as I grow in familiarity with them. The side bar was particularly useful and I don’t think I would be adjusting that anytime soon except for having the option of hiding it momentarily whilst working on the main body of working.</p>
    <p>Trello on the other hand was far more…applicable to the real world, everyone has a notice board or at least fridge magnets to attach tasks to that are reminders to get things done. Trello is probably the most intuitive software package for beginners.</p>

    <h2 id=outcome2_question_two>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
        <i>E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</i></h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>As mentioned in Outcome 1 section 2.1 I have not had time to consider other IT tools I was fairly thankful for the ones presented to me. I was curious about ‘Codepen’ which was offered as a hint to researching this question. I thought that, on account of its name it was going to be a tool where I could carefully outline my images as to my want and then copy and paste the result. But Codepen turned out to be something quite different – more of a constant testing tool that I may look at in more detail next time.</p>
    <p>So I can only talk about what I was given in the course. Namely VS Studio and Trello. Speaking as an amateur I like VS studio because it solved the problem, for me, of where code is written and activated, whether that be Python, HTML or CSS.</p>
    <p>I would like to veryfy if I am writing my html/CSS/and python code in the correct manner with regard to coders ettiquette, I have tried to keep it tidy but Am not sure whether the way I indent things in html is best practice or not, in terms of spotting groups of data and the closing and opening of commands. It would be good if there was a feature that could reset the layout of the code you had typed in a staggered indentation style that is considered industry standard - if there is such a thing, so that I could get used to grasping the utility of doing things that way as early as possible before bad habits set in.</p> 
    <p>It would also be useful, in html if there was some feature for checking that opening tags were closed and where the closure is at, especially if there is a lot of subsequent coding in between, for instance a far-reaching 'container Div'. I spent alot of time manually checking that my divs were opened and closed, not closed twice, enclosed by another tag etc.</p> 
        
    <p>Trello is also good stuff but I do think it could be improved if you could assign a gate keeper to be in charge of changes in status when working in a team, maybe some limits to what team members can make with adjustments to progress so that the board, overall cannot be shuffled around by any members on a whim. Or, otherwise perhaps and alarm notification could be issued every time someone makes a change in status so that team members are not duplicating efforts. These features may well be present and usable already but there has been not enough time to pore over them in this course.</p>

    <h2 id=outcome2_question_three>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your
    final project – <i>are you happy with your website?

        would you change?</i></h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>I think that my website is a little bit uncoordinated at the moment and I would have liked to make it more intuitive, allowing the audience to be able to get back to precisely where they left off if they clicked a link. </p>
    <p>Animations would be a neat thing to add. I wouldn’t venture into something all ‘singing and dancing’ but, in my own time I would like to tweak things so that buttons glow or shiver or changed in opacity (if there is such a piece of code) when the cursor is hovered over them. I think that makes a website more welcoming and kind of…Christmassy rather than flitting to the next part of the site crudely or jerking into a drop down which reminds me of pop ups on a website which drive me to distraction and seem demanding.</p>

</div>
<div>
    <p>From an altruist perspective I would like to also see how far my website was a success for people with disabilities like dyslexia or colour blindness (or color blindness if you are American), and perhaps see how things play out on different devices like smart phones, to test compatiblity. I could have probably have had things look a lot more balanced if I had greater mastery over flex commands which are a bit puzzling to me at the time of writing. The  slightly random images (and personal photographs) that I included to accentuate points I wanted to make (I've called them 'Blip-Memes'), like the duck shooting gallery which is the last image link at the end of answer 1.7; were intended to be features that I imagined could pop up momentarily within the text and then fadeaway, but I was well out of my depth, and the best I could do was was to have them open and direct users in my home page to use the browser back button to return where they left off (denying the option of a fresh tab because the images do not bear later research like website links - I just want them to momentarily add emphasis or interest to a point; and then move on where they left off). This is very clunky but I kept them in as a work in progress. The only way I can currently think of doing it is if I created and treated within their own html page, which might be one way of doing things but I suspect there are better tools out there to avoid that. </p>

    <h2 id=outcome2_question_five>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match
    requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>I think that, in future the best way to review outcomes would be to carefully study how your code turns out at every step of the way in order to render web pages that are as clear as can be, and to ensure that the navigation links go to where I want them to go specifically. Being able to return to where you left off would be an especially good feature for people who may be apprehensive about using IT, because they fear that if they do something wrong or click on something that takes them elsewhere they won't be able to retrace their steps.</p> 
<p>That is what I essentially get nervous about when using a site, especially where money might be involved, or if I am writing an important application. IT professionals should remember that software and computer hardware has taken a quantum leap on the pre-IT mechanical world - the majority of people are at the mercy of software engineers, and, unlike the artisans on the BBC's hit programme <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08l581p" target="_blank">The Repair shop</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXIV]</a>There are probably only handful of people in the world who could design, build or repair silicon circuits. I think this is a root cause of techno-phobia. Without any discernable macro-intuitive handle on the circuitry of IT and the "new" languages and habits that evolve around the software that run on them some people, especially the elderly, may lack confidence to even try.</p>
<p>For my part, whenever I am on a site I want to know how I can get back out, and be sure I can review and ammend whatever decision I make using the software.</p>
<p>On my first attempt here I managed to get an id command to return me to the top of my page - after realising that the href link needed to be around the root menu buttons before the main heading 1 title, but I would have liked users to have returned back to exactly where they hyperlinked from. For instance, if question 1.3 was selected to read first I would have liked the "back to top" link button to return to have returned to that point of launching that hyperlink in the Unit's outcome menu, rather than it being a blanket command to go "back to the top". I realise that a browser’s back button generally serves this purpose, but I would like to be more adept at targeting hrefs to and within images and text far more precisely; so the outcomes appear as planned and so there is always a clear trail of breadcrumbs that is finely tuned and self-evident. At the moment I feel a bit like a one-trick pony in terms of text and image and hyper reference manipulation. This was especially frustrating when it came to linking my references (represented by Roman numerals) within the body text of my Unit Outcome answers to the references listed on the References and Acknowledgments page. I could only get the browser to jump to the beginning of the References and Acknowledgments page. I tried to nest the references numbers there within an id tag, and tried to call it up using the hash command in its corresponding active link in the answers pages, but it would not work, even if I tried to add forward slashes to identify the path to the file and uniquely identify the Roman numeral ref that I wanted to target in the jump - within the anchor points of the id command. I have a feeling that there is some way to do this – and to also jump back to the exact point in the Unit page just left, so I have left the id tags around the Roman numeral numbers in my Acknowledgement and references list to remind me to research and experiment at a later point.</P>
<p>Finally, if this was a professional website  It is probably a good idea to check out the outcomes on all the different browsers likely used to access it just in case there are some peculiarities to each that can be homogenised by tweaking the correct code.</p>
