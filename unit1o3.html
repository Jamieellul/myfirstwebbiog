    <p>Auto correct in VS code a double edged sword, there is no use turning it off at this early stage in my development because it could signify something important. But as I get more experienced maybe I would just bring it into play when I need it and am working on something with code not used before. I have never used it on the on phones, preferring to make my own mistakes and live with them because auto-correct, has a habit of completely screwing up what you are trying to say.</p>
    <p>Coding takes time and concentration and alot of experience before you are likely to inject that flair you desire.  Team work is a balancing act for this kind of pursuit. In order to concentrate a certain ammount of solitude is required to build confidence and solve problems at your own pace. I think that if a group of inexperienced coders tried to go at things together it may work, depending on the mix of people, but it might happen that the most extravert member of a team will probably seize the spotlight and every other members of the group might be cowed to express themselves. Team work, in this field, I think is best left to regular check-ups and exchanging of ideas, allowing the quieter folk to take things forward after each such session on their own terms.</p>
    <p>If you are constantly thinking about how everyone else might do things when you are doing them, even if you are completely wrong, and stand corrected later, you are likely to freeze up and lose confidence. On the other hand it is useful to check in with others when you've exhausted your own approach to a problem or found the written guidance you find during research is to arcane to make sense to you or does not quite fit what you were looking to solve. Each coder should have a go at things to build confidence and meet up regualarly with colleagues to exchange ideas or perspectives for approaching problems. Too much at either end of the spectrum can lead you going down rabbit holes or convincing yourself you have no aptitude. </p>

    <h2 id=outcome3_question_two>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and
        efficiency</h2>
</div>

    <p>I think that the biggest lesson I learnt in terms of productivity and efficiency was making sure I understood what the requirements of this assignment were before expending time on it. I knew that we would have to produce a basic first time website to demonstrate our learning, however, I completely went into a meltdown when I was told that we have to complete this written work that I am engaged in now. For some reason I thought that that the two things were separate enterprises and that I would have to scour the internet for answers to the questions whilst simultaneously planning a web-page of my own design. This was my fault.</p>
    <p>I obviously must have gone to the loo or made a cup of tea and been distracted when it was revealed that the website that Code Nation wanted us to build was with the content that the “written work” prompted us to answer. I missed that vital point, went into a complete tailspin and spent a couple of days frantically trying to come up with an idea for a website, glancing at the questions and getting distracted by them, thinking “this code nation course is very intense!!” If only I had established the correct requirements, I could have done saved myself a lot of grief. So always be clear of requirements before setting off, is the biggest lesson I have learnt.</p>

    <h2 id=outcome3_question_three>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity 
        using IT in digital projects – <i>what would you do
        differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</i></h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>I have never done a digital project until signing up for this course but I have been kind of fascinated by the tools presented to me that keep people in contact whilst on the move. Before now I could touch type and use windows; Excel, Word, PowerPoint and communicate by email</p>
    <p>I was always a bit intrigued why people on trains and buses were glued to their screens; thinking - give your eye-sight a rest  and look out the window or you are going to get travel sick - since I assumed they were working on a word document or updating a spreadsheet!
    But its likely they were not working on core tasks but catching up with the rest of their team through the likes of software like Trello and Slack, which is less draining on a mobile phone or a small tablet than poring over coding. And was probably morale boosting whilst saving time for progressing the project once at work since the the days agenda and issues had been sorted whilst on the move</p>
    <p>So that is what I would plan for in future: big comfortable screens and settings to get down to the main project actually at work, whilst devoting time spent on the move engaging in catch-ups and general planning with the more ‘sociable’ team access software platforms.</p>

    <h2 id=outcome3_question_four>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing
        digital solutions</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Probably the best way of testing digital solutions would be to kidnap friends and family and get them to go through your website or adventure game and see what they have to say. One of the lecuturers at Code Nation briefed us on several different coding languages, including one called “Mum_on_Facebook”! My mother’s expert grasp of MOF syntax is uncanny, and she does not mince her words so I would probably test out the navigation of my site on her.</p>
    <p>Family and friends aside another, more experienced, coder would probably be the most productive alliance to build. They could point you in the right direction to test out your webpage on different browsers and in different resolutions and give you some tips.</p>
    <p>Coding is very taxing when you are new to it. Trying to simultaneously learn and produce was a bit of a mind bender. I had a clear idea of how I wanted my simple website to look but got very confused by Flexbox and GitHub and what it is all about and that was distracting.</p>       
    <p>I think poise and determination, mixed with a fair degree of humbleness is key to a good developer’s success. Accepting that things can be done another way and being resolute about accepting that advice or (politely) rejecting it if your advisor really has misinterpreted what your area of difficulty is important. This is why all our Code Nation lecturers have stressed the importance of research and emphasised that it is a constant requirement, in order to keep refining your knowledge</p>
    <p>Nobody seems to know the full picture is what I have noticed, IT is a shifting sand-scape and there is no shame in learning and improving, in-fact, continual learning and sharing seems to be what binds users of digital software together. </p>
    <p>returning to VS code - in terms of productivity, I like the fact that you are able to "comment out" areas of code so that you can focus on particular aspects that you are having problems with. Also, in future, I think that I would actually leave notes for myself in VS code alot more, at least until I am fully conversant in a particular use of an element. I made notes throughout my course elsewhere. But it makes more sense, to leave yourself tips within the code that are commented out, as they will be adjacent to your solutions or to what new findings you have come across as you are practicing your craft.</p>
