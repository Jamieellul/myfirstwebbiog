    <h2 id=outcome2_question_one>(2) 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each Page</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>In my case the idea I came up with was very much an example of necessity being the mother of invention. I had, as mentioned, made the schoolboy error of mistaking this written work as separate from the website. So when I realised, somewhat gratefully, that I didn’t have to devise a website connected with things that interest me I got a bit flummoxed having wasted vital time. So grand designs went out of the window and, for that matter would have been impossible for a novice like me. </p>
    <p>What I decided was to keep it simple and selected a series of silhouettes of myself that a photographer friend of mine took when he was experimenting with some of his kit about a year ago. He set things up so that my colleagues and I could stand inside the frame and press a trigger ourselves that would trigger the shutter. It proved very popular with staff and we all queued up to experiment with it.</p>
    <p>What I envisaged was these silhouettes to be rendered on each page with gold or crimson buttons for navigation; A kind of luxury dart chocolate vibe was what I was aiming for. I thought I could perhaps put a button in my skull and content in my torso or else to one side in a neat column if the former idea looked messy. I also like the fact that in one image I am scratching my head and in another seem to be cringing so thought that would be a neat page to come up when answering trickier questions or discussing problems encountered.</p>
    <p>And finally my acknowledgments page would be the odd one out, where I present with my hand my thanks for the Code Nation team, colleagues and then sew things up with a list of references at the end.</p>

    <h2 id=outcome2_question_five>(2) 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Unless you are writing something or creating something yourself from scratch then the sources you are borrowing from are subject to copyright laws. </p>
    <p>These laws exist so that the person who is the creator can be reimbursed for the effort that they put in to say an essay, or other literary work, a painting, a piece of music of a design on which a product is produced (which is why anyone with a great idea should lay claim to it and be granted acknowledgment in the form of patent – Preferably before appearing on Dragons Den!).</p>
    <p>The copyright may not necessarily be yours by default if, for instance you are working for a company where your contract includes a disclaimer that makes the copyright the property of that company if produced in paid time expended. </p>
    <p>There are two types of copyright in The United Kingdom and the commonwealth; regular copyright and Crown copyright. Copyright is a notoriously tricky subject to get to grips with and more so since the advent of the internet and technological advances since the latter part of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>One of the best books on the subject is <a href="http://www.facetpublishing.co.uk/title.php?id=304486"target="_blank"> Copyright for Archivists</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXV]</a> by Tim Padman, who works for the National Archives, and is renowned as an expert in the subject.</p>  
    <p>His book is carefully crafted into a series of bullet points and includes flow diagrams in the appendix that can help you plot the expiry date of copyright in various forms so that you can be confident of being on safe ground. His interest in the subject was a direct result of being an archivist where primary materials are used all the time by researchers and a there was a definite need to break down the laws for guidance to scholars.</p>
    <p>Since its initial print it has been updated several times and has now grown to include advice regarding websites, data sets and other developments in information output in our technological age. </p>
    <p>The surprising thing about copyright is that it does not have to be substantial. You do not have to write a published novel to claim copyright. You can lay claim to a scribble on the back of coaster as your copyright. Though proving such matters could get complicated.</p>
    <p>By and large though students and researchers engaged in educational endeavours are granted leeway, and can borrow from others if they are not unduly profiting from the act.</p>
    <p>The best way to safe guard yourself is to cite your sources if known, and make yourself available for negotiation with copyright owners if you could not trace them and they later surface and contact you if the project does reap monetary of reputational reward.</p>
    <p>Other constraints affecting websites are, as already discussed, the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) which restricts the storing and sharing of personal data, especially what may be visible to the general public on a website. Furthermore, government websites and those that act as the window on institutions that are funded by the public purse must concede to make information that they hold readily available under the Freedom of Information act (barn what comes into conflict with GDPR protections of personal data) in order that our society can keep taxpayers’ money and its allocation under scrutiny and to otherwise hold those in public office accountable for their actions</p>

    <h2 id=outcome2_question_six>(2) 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into
        account - describe issues that people with
        disabilities may face when using webpages and
        how we can overcome them
        </h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>I think that the people with disabilities should be asked directly when deciding upon what the needs are for such people, who may be challenged by their physical of physiological impairments in ways you might not imagine. It has to be a balancing act though, if you try to please everyone then you end up with a substantially poorer product. For instance, someone who has acute arachnophobia can hardly ban all websites about spiders.</p>
    <p>That is an extreme example though. I am intrigued by how blind people navigate websites. Obviously a vocal element is necessary but how do they really enjoy their online experience and how can that be improved? Maybe that is a challenge for hardware developers rather than software. Imagine a device for blind people which, as opposed to a traditional keyboard is far more tactile and, perhaps does not even resemble a traditional keyboard? Something more like a Wii device with clickable options that increase heat or glow in the hands or send other sensory indicators?</p>
    <p>All in all, a good coder should keep accessibility in mind and ensure that it is tested on people of different demographics and who have different life challenges to face. Web content for most sites needs to be tested by the target audience, and modified within the time limits available to be a success.</p>

    <h2 id=outcome2_question_seven>(2) 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types
        for websites</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>I think that the selection of correct file types will come with experience. I have tried researching the subject but everyone has their own opinion, and the options are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types"target="_blank">manifold</a><a href="acknowledgments&refs.html"> [XXVI]</a>...</p>
    <p>Our tutor advised us to keep images as large as possible so that resolution when honing them down to fit the site remained strong. As I understand it Tiff. Images are the clearest in terms of resolution but I had none of those, but Jpegs seem to be the most popular, so I am hoping they will work for me. This is very difficult questions to answer but I suspect that different horses work for different courses and that some file types will turn out better on particular browsers, and particular devices. I like my major backdrop images but am not so happy with with the rest of my photos and the 'blip-meme' pictures, that are poor in quality. Hopefully they add a modicum of interest and amusement to my site even if they are very amatuerish. With more  experience I hope to get them to appear momentarily and dissolve away when clicked on, as I imagined might be possible. Maybe by the time you read this I will have a new version of my blog on Github that does that kind of thing.</p>
