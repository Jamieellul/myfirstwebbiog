    <p>This is my attempt at building a basic webpage using html and CSS (as well as learning Python), after signing up for a distance learning course called Develop Coding, offered to beginners by the organisation <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/virtual-learning/"target="_blank">Code Nation</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXVII]</a> 
        Their course leads to a Level 2 Certificate in IT User Skills in Open Systems and Enterprise accredited by <a href="https://tlm.org.uk/qualifications2/certificate-in-open-systems-computing"target="_blank">The Learning Machine (TLM)</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXVIII]</a>  
        
        I came across Code Nation via my DWP work coach (currently in a Covid 19 employment vacuum). I enquired out of curiosity, unsure whether I had the qualifications needed, but was encouraged by the admissions advisor, Ezra, to enrol. He assured me that this was a way in if I was willing to learn – and that it was a myth that you had to learn it in childhood to get good at it. What I have found, to my surprise was, not only is the course accessible for beginners - but that what I have been taught are skills after which previously hankered. During my career there had been numerous occasions, during down time, where I had tried to ‘hack’ Microsoft Office software- Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. to do things for which they were not purpose-built. On one time I researched the hues in the colour palate on our website and saved examples and their pantone numbers in a word document for people to access and consult for their communications. On another occasion I tried to use Excel to plot out staff availability and personnel needs to cover imminent expansion plans, compared to the scope of our current coverage, with due consideration to colleague’s annual leave and average previous sick leave – I reached a result of kinds but it was visually confusing, looked cumbersome, and had to be completely rehashed, manually, whenever new data arose. Because, there were no inputs and outcomes, like may have been achieved by coding the project in python – it just turned out to be a confusing piece of written work. Here is an example of another questionable ‘hack’: I tried to produce visual guide contents of shelve stacks in my repository by turning an excel bar chart into the shelves in the stacks, colouring each “shelf”, hiding all the measurements, turning the key into a list of contents by accentuating the key to content the colour assigned to them and then pasting each stack into word to make <a href="images/Aislesignexcelhack.jpg">posters</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXIX]</a> to pin up on each stack’s end in the repository. The problem was there was, without any link to code that could be updated in line with our holdings database of content locations I had to manually check and change things every time stuff was shifted about, so it was all a bit <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/heath-robinson-deserves-a-museum"target="_blank">Heath Robinson</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXX]</a> in execution <i>and</i> purpose and essentially needed a combination of some kind coding combined with Html/CSS shich would enable changes to be input as time went on of which I was ignorant at the time. 
         
        However, from now on, I think the tools that Code Nation have revealed on their Develop Coding course and the resources they have signposted have opened up vistas of possible solutions to these kind of things and incepted and interest in coding that I would have never ventured had I not enquired and made a start with them. So I have a new hobby!

    <h2 id=about_me>About Me</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>I’m Jame. I come from Portsmouth, though now live in London. I’m a qualified archivist and worked for 15 years at the <a href="https://www.postalmuseum.org/news/the-postal-museum-collaborates-with-leading-academics-to-analyse-health-of-postal-workers-in-victorian-and-edwardian-times/"target="_blank">The Postal Museum</a>.<a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXXI]</a>
       Before that I worked as a Drawing controller in construction, and as a landscape gardener in Chelsea - for the fashion designer, Tom Ford at one point (though I cracked his garden sculpture with the mower one session, so I think he might be a bit miffed with me). 
        Earlier to settling in London I was based in Hong for 2 years working mostly for a video production house. I left Hong Kong after working with a team of Australian outdoor stage riggers; they were short-handed for labour and hired some friends and I to get a stage erected in happy Valley Race course - during a monsoon! We all ended up with trench-foot after working 16 hour days for a week, but they were impressed by our work ethic and they invited us to Australia to work on a couple of gigs. Out in Oz we built a stage for the opera <a href="Images/aida.jpg">Aida</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXXII]</a> in Brisbane, and then rigged a stage in <a href="Images/hydraulicstageleg.jpg">South Australian dessert</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXXIII]</a>  for a show called Opera in the Outback (all under the watchful eye of our charge-hand <a href="Images/mutly.jpg">Mutley the Dog</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXXIV]</a> Mutley the Dog).
        Prior to that I was a <a href="Images/pirate.jpg">pirate</a> <a href="acknowledgments&refs.html">[XXXV]</a> but that all came to an end when the galleon went up in flames and we all had to jump into the sea to escape.
